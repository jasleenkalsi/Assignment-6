## Can I explain what my code does?
My code creates a trivia game where questions load from an API, and players can enter answers, track scores, and save their session.

## What was my coding process?
I planned each step, used separate branches to stay organized, and tested frequently to catch issues early.

## What challenges did I have?
Managing the loading state and handling errors with the API was tricky. I fixed this by adding a loading animation and error display.

## What would I do differently now?
Iâ€™d focus on making the code simpler, especially in session handling, and think more about error handling from the start.
